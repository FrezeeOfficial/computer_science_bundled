CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindMariaDB.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "MariaDB", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "MariaDB" with any
  of the following names:

    MariaDBConfig.cmake
    mariadb-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "MariaDB" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "MariaDB_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "MariaDB" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
